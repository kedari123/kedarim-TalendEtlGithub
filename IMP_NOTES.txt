Best practices:
--------------

1. Naming Convenctions.
2. Metadata scan.
3. Context Parameters(Mandatory) and No Hardcoding of values.
4. Null handling.
5. Logs and Stat tables.
6. If it is a File --> Schema check.(tSchemaComplainceCheck)
7. Email notifications. 


Performance Tuning Techniques:-
-----------------------------

1. Multi thread execution.
2. Iterate link - Parallel Execution.
3. JVM parameters
4. Store temp data - tMap
5. Sort on disk - tSortRow

6. Input is DB:
    a)create index on top of key columns.
	b)parallel hint - /*+parallel(4)*/
	c)fetch size/cursor size
	
7. output as DB:
	a)commit size
	b)batch size
	
	
TMAP:-
====

1. We can use it as tFilterRow
2. We can use it as tReplicate (One input and Many output)
3. We can use it as tFilterColumn (We can remove and re-arrange the columns)
4. We can perform String Handling Functions.
5. We can perform Date Functions.
6. We can Handle Nulls - Relational.ISNULL()
7. We can generate Sequence - Numeric.Sequence("S1",1,1)
8. We can create new columns (Calc fields/Hard coded values)
9. We can change the Date patterns.
10. We can create Variables and Re-use them when ever required.
11. We can perform Math functions.
12. We can perform Joins(Inner and Left outer) - By doing workaround we can achieve Right anf Full outer Joins
13. We have lookup models like Load once and Reload at Each row
14. When we are facing Heap memory issue or MemoryOutOfBound :- Increase JVM Parameters (Run tab --> Advance Settings)
15. Store temp data as true - To do the look up in your ROM
16. We can capture Output reject data.
17. We can capture Inner join Reject data.
18. Join N no.of tables (One main and remaining are lookups)
