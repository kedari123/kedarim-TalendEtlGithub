hi , myself ked. 
i have 4+ years of experience in this data ware housing, using talend as an ETL,

 coming to the projects i have worked on a data warehousing, data integration.....  

   recent project is completely into data warehousing,
  we have extracted the data from different sources like oracle,sqlserver,flatfiles like csv,txt,xml,json and excel .


  and using incremental load we have loaded the data to the staging layer, its  like mirror to the source data. 
  and then we loaded data to the enterprise data ware house layer, here we have scd1,scd2 inplementation based on clint requirement
   and fact loading and all. apart from this we have loaded the data to the reporting layer and on top of it we have tablu dashboards 

  and we have etl frame work which is used to capture the logs...
  like   job_execution_log
       audit log
       error records to error tables with proper reject reasons
     so all this we have worked on current assignment 


basically for reporting purpose we will create views on top of it on the reporting layer to show the data in a dash board.... 
 on top of a view it can store the data in some temporary location we called as a meterialised view till have a refresh interval

select e1.month,e1.revenue-e2.revenue as diff_revenue from sales e1,sales e2 where e1.product<>e2.product;
